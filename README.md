# Psychic-Game

This is a "Psychic Game," where the objective is to guess a letter in the alphabet that the program will randomly generate. You have a total of 9 tries to guess the correct letter, and if you get it right before the end you win (indicated by the win counter). If you use up all the guesses, you lose (indicated by the loss counter). Enjoy!
